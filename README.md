# Landing Page Project

## Introduction
The project is an assignment of Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree online course. The project uses javascript (in js/app.js) to give interactive behaviours to elements on index.html. Implemented features are:  
- Navbar menu items are dynamically generated from the sections in body;
- User will be navigated to corresponding section by clicking on the item on navbar menu;
- When navigating through the sections by clicking or scrolling, the displaying section will be highlighted.

## Usage
You can host the project on a local Nginx, tomcat or any other development server and open the index.html on the correct portal to try out the effects.
